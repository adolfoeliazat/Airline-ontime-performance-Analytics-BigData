#### Airline-ontime-performance-Analytics-BigData
The goal for this project:
* Explore different big data technologies.
* Analyze airline on-time performance from different aspects.
* Build a prediction model: predict flight delays.
* Interative Visualization: web application.

##### Main Technologies Used
  * Hadoop, HBase, Hive, Apache Phoenix, Pig, AWS
  * D3.js, morris.js, crossfilter.js, Bootstrap framework 
  * Spark ML-Lib (Logistic regression)

##### Usage:
1. Airports Information
  * Airports location overview
  * Search airports location by State
  * Search airports location by airport code

2. Airline Popularity Analysis
  * Analyze airline popularity in terms of number of flights from 1987 to 2008
    * Top N airline based on year
  * How’s those airlines performance look like on 2008?
    * Average arrival delay information for those airlines

3. Performance Analysis
  * 2008 On-time performance Analysis
    * How does arrival delay relate to time of day?
    * How does arrival delay relate to distance?
    * How does arrival delay relate to date?
    * Can we see flight detail for each date?
  * Airline Performance
    * How’s 5 Large Domestic Airline Performance look like every year?
    * What is the trend of those airline performance?
  * Airports Performance
    * What is average arrival delay for each airport?
    
4. Delay Cause Analysis
  * What is the main delay reason?
  * What is the distribution of delay reasons?

5. Predict Delays
  * Build prediction model to predict delays
    * How to know if my flight will delay?
